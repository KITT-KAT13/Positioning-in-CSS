 <h1>The Warrior Scroll</h1>
  <p class="box static ">At a small-town museum, an author named Mr. Lorne and his daughter Ella were exploring ancient displays. Behind an
ornamental vase, Ella spotted an old scroll in a section marked “No admittance.”</p>  

<p class="box relative">Dad, that scroll isn’t listed on the display board,” she whispered.</p>

<p class="box absolute">Mr. Lorne, intrigued, took a closer look. It was a forgotten manuscript—a rare scroll that had been misplaced years ago
due to a filing error. Suddenly, alarms buzzed, lights flashed, and guards came rushing in.</p>

<p class="box fixed">There was uproar in the museum. Staff thought someone had tried to steal the scroll, and everyone was sent into
quarantine while the situation was sorted out.</p>

<p class="box sticky"> But after the confusion, the museum thanked Ella for her discovery.</p>
